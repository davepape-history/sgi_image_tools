<h1>Dave's image tools</h1>
<h3> by Dave Pape (dave.pape@acm.org)
</h3>

The following programs are tools for manipulating SGI-format images,
similar to Paul Haeberli's <i>imgtools</i> suite from SGI.
<p>
To recompile some of these programs you will need my
libdave library.

<dl>
<dt><b>addover</b> <i>underimage overimage outimage [xpos ypos]</i>
</dt><dd>A cross between <b>/usr/sbin/add</b> and <b>/usr/sbin/over</b>,
  this allows you to add
  two images which are of different sizes. <i>overimage</i> is added to
  <i>underimage</i> with its lower left corner at pixel location <i>xpos,ypos</i>.
  <i>outimage</i> will be the same size as <i>underimage</i>. 

</dd><dt><b>colorover</b> <i>inimage alphaimage outimage red green blue</i>
</dt><dd>Similar to <b>matte</b> (see below), but simplified to overlay a
  fixed color instead of a second image. <i>red,green,blue</i> specifies
  the color to overlay; each channel should have values between 0 and 255.
  The blending is done using the greyscale image <i>alphaimage</i> to
  define the overlay color's opacity (0 alpha yields the color
  of <i>inimage</i>, 255 alpha yields the overlay color).

</dd><dt><b>colorunder</b> <i>inimage alphaimage outimage red green blue</i>
</dt><dd>Same as <b>colorover</b>, except that the color is added under the
  image (or, the image is added over the constant color). <i>alphaimage</i>
  in this case defines the opacity of <i>inimage</i> - 0 yields the
  underlay color, 255 yields the color of <i>inimage</i>.

</dd><dt><b>dissolve</b> <i>inpattern1 inpattern2 outpattern startframe endframe [step]</i>
</dt><dd> Creates a dissolve between two sequences of images. <i>inpattern1</i> and
  <i>inpattern2</i> are printf format strings which, with the frame
  number, will generate the file names for the frames of the two input
  sequences (via a <i>sprintf(filename,pattern,framenum)</i>.
  For example, "Frame.%04d.sgi" will cause <b>dissolve</b> to
  read the file "Frame.0001.sgi" for frame number 1. <i>outpattern</i> is
  a similar format string for the output file names. The frame numbers
  go from <i>startframe</i> to <i>endframe</i>, optionally stepping by
  <i>step</i>. The dissolve blends linearly between the two sequences;
  at frame <i>startframe</i>, the output image will be identical to the
  input image from sequence 1; at frame <i>endframe</i>, the output will
  be identical to the input from sequence 2. A constant image can be used
  for either input sequence by just giving the exact file name of the image.

</dd><dt><b>fade</b> <i>inimage1 inimage2 outimage-basename frames</i>
</dt><dd> Similar to <b>dissolve</b>, but creates a dissolve between two fixed
  images rather than two sequences (it's faster than <b>dissolve</b>
  for this special case). <i>inimage1</i> and <i>inimage2</i> are the
  two input images. The output images will all have the name <i>outimage-basename</i>
  followed by the frame number (zero padded to 4 digits). <i>frames</i> is
  the number of frames the dissolve should take. For example,
  <i>fade foo.sgi bar.sgi baz 10</i> will generate the files
  <i>baz0000</i>, <i>baz0001</i>, ... <i>baz0009</i>.

</dd><dt><b>fill-holes</b> <i>inimage.bw outimage.bw [num-passes]</i>
</dt><dd> A little hack to fill in "holes" in a greyscale image. Every pixel
  whose intensity value is 0 is replaced by the average of its non-zero
  neighbors. If <i>num-passes</i> is greater than one, the process is
  repeated this many times, allowing larger gaps to be filled in.
  This program is handy for removing fine details such as grid lines
  from a map. Note: only supports 1 band images; all remaining bands in
  the image will be ignored.

</dd><dt><b>fromfloat</b> <i>indata outimage.sgi xdim ydim [min max]</i>
</dt><dd> Similar to <b>/usr/sbin/frombin</b>; converts a file of raw floating
  point data into an SGI image. <i>indata</i> should be a file of unformatted
  data - basically an array of <i>xdim</i>*<i>ydim</i> floats. The data
  will all be scaled to the range 0 to 255 and written out as an <i>xdim</i>
  by <i>ydim</i> greyscale image (<i>outimage.sgi</i>). If <i>min</i> and
  <i>max</i> are not given, the data will be scaled so that the smallest
  value in <i>indata</i> will map to pixel value 0, and the largest will
  map to 255. If <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> are given, any input values less
  than or equal to <i>min</i> will map to 0, and any input values greater
  than or equal to <i>max</i> will map to 255. Values between the minimum
  and maximum map linearly to the range 0 to 255.

</dd><dt><b>fromhsv</b> <i>inimage.sgi outimage.sgi</i>
</dt><dd> Reverses the conversion of <b>tohsv</b>. <i>inimage.sgi</i> is a three
  band SGI image; band 0 is interpreted as hue, band 1 as saturation, and
  band 2 as value. The pixel colors of the image are converted back to RGB space
  and written out as <i>outimage.sgi</i>.

</dd><dt><b>fromlong</b> <i>inimage.32 outimage.sgi xdim ydim [min max]</i>
</dt><dd> Similar to <b>fromfloat</b>, except that the input data (<i>inimage.32</i>)
  are signed long integers.

</dd><dt><b>fromshort</b> <i>inimage.16 outimage.sgi xdim ydim [min max]</i>
</dt><dd> Similar to <b>fromfloat</b>, except that the input data (<i>inimage.16</i>)
  are signed short integers.

</dd><dt><b>get-matte</b> <i>inimage.sgi outmatte.sgi bg-r bg-g bg-b [dist]</i>
</dt><dd> Creates an alpha channel for an image which leaves out the given
  background color. <i>inimage.sgi</i> is the input image; <i>outmatte.sgi</i>
  is the one band output matte (alpha) image; <i>bg-r,bg-g,bg-b</i> is
  the RGB color (values from 0 to 255) of the background. For any pixel
  of <i>inimage.sgi</i> which is the background color, the value of the
  corresponding pixel of <i>outmatte.sgi</i> is 0; otherwise, the output
  value is 255. If <i>dist</i> is given, any pixel whose color's Euclidean
  distance (in RGB space) from <i>bg-r,bg-g,bg-b</i> is less than or equal
  to <i>dist</i> is considered part of the background.

</dd><dt><b>imgcmp</b> <i>image1.sgi image2.sgi</i>
</dt><dd> A <b>/bin/cmp</b> for images. Only the dimensions and pixel values of
  the two images are compared (<b>cmp</b> might say that two image files are
  different only due to meaningless header differences, or because one is
  run-length-encoded and the other is not). A message is printed indicating
  whether the two images are identical or if they are different (and where
  they first differ).

</dd><dt><b>imggrad</b> <i>inimage outimage</i>
</dt><dd>Creates a gradient image of the (greyscale) input image. For each input
  pixel, the corresponding output pixel has an value proportional to the
  magnitude of the color gradient at that point. The output values are
  scaled to cover the range 0 to 255. This can be used as a very simple
  edge-detector.

</dd><dt><b>imgrange</b> <i>in-image out-image new-min new-max</i>
</dt><dd> The dual of <b>/usr/sbin/imgexp</b>. This will rescale an image's pixel
  values so that they will cover the range <i>new-min</i> to <i>new-max</i>.

</dd><dt><b>matte</b> <i>underimage overimage matteimage outimage [xpos ypos]</i>
</dt><dd> Composites one image on top of another. <i>overimage</i> is blended
  over <i>underimage</i> using <i>matteimage</i> as the alpha channel.
  The output color of a pixel is a linear combination of the colors of
  the corresponding pixels in the two input images; the value of the
  pixel in the alpha image is the blending factor. When the alpha is 0,
  the result is the color from <i>underimage</i>; when the alpha is 255,
  the result is the color from <i>overimage</i>. If <i>xpos</i> and <i>ypos</i>
  are given, <i>overimage</i> is composited with its lower left corner at
  pixel coordinates (<i>xpos</i>,<i>ypos</i>) of <i>underimage</i>.

</dd><dt><b>minmax</b> <i>[-&lt;type&gt;] file</i>
</dt><dd> Finds the minimum and maximum values in a file of raw data (not an
  SGI image). <i>type</i> is the type of the data in <i>file</i>; it can
  be <i>float</i>, <i>long</i>, <i>ulong</i> (unsigned long), <i>short</i>,
  <i>ushort</i>, <i>char</i>, or <i>uchar</i>. This can be useful in
  conjunction with <b>fromfloat</b>, <b>fromlong</b>, and <b>fromshort</b>
  to choose the min &amp; max values they use.

</dd><dt><b>remapimg</b> <i>inimage outimage map.txt</i>
</dt><dd> Remaps the pixel values of a single band image. <i>map.txt</i> is a
  text file containing 256 numbers. The first number is the new value for
  any pixels whose input value is 0; the second is the new value for pixels
  with input value 1; etc.

</dd><dt><b>replay</b> <i>[-s] [image ...]</i>
</dt><dd> Displays a sequence of images in a GL window, similar to <b>/usr/sbin/movie</b>.
  The image file names can either be given on the command line, or on standard
  input. The <i>-s</i> flag runs <b>replay</b> in "slideshow" mode, where
  each image is displayed until the left mouse button or the return key
  is pressed; otherwise, the images are flipped through as quickly as they
  can be read. The escape key will exit from the program at any time.
  This is useful for examining a series of frames once, without loading
  up memory with all the images.

</dd><dt><b>smear</b> <i>inimage smearimage outimage [scale]</i>
</dt><dd> "Smears" the colors in an image based on the gradient of another
  (greyscale) image. For each pixel of <i>outimage</i>, the gradient vector
  of the corresponding pixel in <i>smearimage</i> is computed;
  this vector is added to the pixel's position, and the color at the resulting
  position in <i>inimage</i> is used for the output color. The gradient vectors
  are multiplied by <i>scale</i> if it is given.

</dd><dt><b>tohsv</b> <i>inimage.sgi outimage.sgi</i>
</dt><dd> Converts an image from RGB color space to HSV. For each pixel in the
  input image, its RGB color values are converted to HSV values and written
  to the output image; band 0 of <i>outimage.sgi</i> is the hue, band 1 is
  the saturation, and band 2 is the value. This can be useful if you
  wish to apply other image tools to the HSV values of an image; the
  final result can then be converted back to RGB using <b>fromhsv</b>.

</dd><dt><b>wipe</b> <i>inpattern1 inpattern2 wipepattern outpattern startframe endframe [step]</i>
</dt><dd> A time-sequence versions of <b>matte</b>, for creating animated wipes
  or other transitions between two sequences of images. <i>inpattern1</i> and
  <i>inpattern2</i> are printf format strings for the two input sequences,
  as in <b>dissolve</b>; <i>wipepattern</i> is a format string for the alpha
  channel; <i>outpattern</i> is a format string for the output images.
  The frame numbers run from <i>startframe</i> to <i>endframe</i>, optionally
  stepping by <i>step</i>. For each frame, the image from the second sequence
  is composited over the image from the first sequence, using the "wipe"
  image as the alpha channel, as in <b>matte</b>.
