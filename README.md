# sgi_image_tools

This is a collection of small programs for doing various things with images in the SGI image format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics_Image).  I created them as a supplement to the standard SGI programs by Paul Haeberli et al.  They were used for many projects at the NASA/GSFC Scientific Visualization Studio in the early 1990s.
